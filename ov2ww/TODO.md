# To Do

- [ ] Continue to clean up the script
- [ ] Format the student numbers to seven digits
- [ ] Format the section numbers to two digits
- [ ] Perhaps a better way to handle removing the accents  
    ```python
    if args.no_accents:
        try import etc

    for row in reader:
        if args.no_accents:
            for field in accent_fields:
                row[fields[field][lang]] = process_name(row[fields[field][lang]])
    ```
